## Overview

This repository contains the analysis and workflow for exploring the distribution of affordable housing projects across Torontoâ€™s wards. The primary goal of this project is to assess progress of Toronto affordable housing initiatives and provide insights into Toronto's housing pipeline. Using publicly available data from Open Data Toronto's Affordable Housing Pipeline, we cleaned and analyzed the dataset to uncover significant differences between wards, with some areas significantly outpacing others in terms of numbers of affordable housing projects, highlighting the need for a more equitable distribution of resources and development efforts. We also found that majority affordable housing projects are early-stage, underscoring  the need for accelerated progress to ensure timely completion and addressing housing needs across all wards in Toronto.. 

Some of the R code used to create this work was adapted from Alexander (2023).

- `outputs/data` contains the cleaned data utilized for analysis in this paper, as well as the simulated data used for testing purposes.
- `outputs/paper` contains  a PDF version of the final paper, the Quarto file used to generate the PDF, and a file with the paper's references.
- `scripts` contains R scripts for data simulation, downloading, cleaning, and testing.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of the AI tool, Chatgpt. The abstract, introduction and discussion were written with the help of Chatgpt and the entire chat history is available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.
